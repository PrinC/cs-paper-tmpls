# cs-paper-tmpls
This repo includes common paper templates for Computer Science papers, mostly with my own preferences.
 More specfically, for each well-known tex template, I include:
* the basic `.sty` file and sample `.tex` entry
* day-to-day packages, organized and grouped 
* handy helper macros
* draft version settings (commenting-out some blocks)
* makefile
